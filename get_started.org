#+Title: Get Started with K8s on Minikube

To check if virtualization is supported on Linux, run the following command and verify that the output is non-empty:

#+BEGIN_SRC
  grep -E --color 'vmx|svm' /proc/cpuinfo
#+END_SRC

To install minikube on Linux

#+BEGIN_SRC
  curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64 \
  && chmod +x minikube

  Hereâ€™s an easy way to add the Minikube executable to your path:

  sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/
  sudo install minikube /usr/local/bin/
#+END_SRC

Note:-

- Make sure you do have Hypervisor installed like KVM or VirtualBox
- Make sure you do have kubectl installed [[scripts/install_kubectl.sh]]
