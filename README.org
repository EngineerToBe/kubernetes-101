#+Title: Kubernetes Labs

This is my first step towards organizing ther K8s ecosystem components and try to explain how they are coupled with each other.

* Setting up your Kubernetes cluster: Minikube

We will use minikube as our Kubernetes cluster. Minikube is an official tool maintained by the Kubernetes community to be able to provision and run Kubernetes locally your machine.
By having a local environment you can have fast iteration cycles while you develop and play with Kubernetes before deploying to production.

To setup minikube:

    [[https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/][Install kubectl]]
    [[https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/][Install Minikube]]
    Run minikube start to provision a new minikube instance on your local machine.
    Verify setup with kubectl: kubectl cluster-info
